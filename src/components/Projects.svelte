			event: `Early detection of rumours and assessing their veracity is a key problem. The learning mechanism analyses the socio-linguistic data 
			and the features of the social graph of the Tweet. We first perform a graph and text based rumour detection, followed by classifying the stance of the Tweet. We then finally predict whether the Tweet in question is True or not. `,

		{
			title: 'Cloud Computing - DbaaS - Container Orchestrator',
			event: `This simulates a ride-sharing application. The orchestrator exposes the read and write API endpoints. Out of all the worker containers, one of them is elected as the master. We have used queues for message exchanges. 
			We scale up/down the number of containers based on the number of incoming HTTP requests. We use Zookeeper for fault tolerance.

		{
			title: 'Product Expiry Notification System',
			event: `Built a product expiry notification system to scan and predict the expiry date of certain household essentials. 
			Used OCR, Android Studio, an ANN and an ANOVA test to implement the solution.
			This used an adam optimizer, an MSE as its loss function and was finally evaluated on its cosine proximity. We then used a Graph Neural Network to compare functioning of models.

		{
			title: 'Lie Detection System - Eagle Strategy',
			event: `This has 3 parts, camera for facial features, recording device for voice and IOT devices for body movements. 
			The truth value of every line in a conversation is captured. Based on this, we trained our deep neural network to classify the given data as a truth or lie. I used the Eagle Strategy in place of the generic back propagation algorithm used in a neural network.`,

		},
		{
			title: 'Naive Bayes Classifier',
			event: `This classifies whether a person is a democrat or republican based on 16 binary attributes and 2 classes. I estimated the accuracy of Naive Bayes algorithm using 5-fold cross validation on the dataset given. 
			Implemented the model from scratch, without using any libraries. 
			A decision tree, using the ID3 algorithm, has also been used to classify data and compare the performances of the two classifiers.`,

		{
			title: 'C++ Compiler using the C Language',
			event: `This is to build a compiler for the C++ programing language, using the C programming language. The compiler handles 'do', 'do-while' loops and 'if' conditional statements. The phases of this project include the lexical, syntactic, semantic analysis. Post that, we work on the intermediate code generation, optimisation and finally generate the target assembly code.`,

		},
		{
			title: 'Stock Market Analysis and Prediction',
			event: `This helps users make decisions when investing in the stock market. On the basis of data collected over a long period of time, 
			this uses support vector regression  to predict the upcoming month's price of a stock. It uses Flask and jQuery for the backend, and
			Angluar for the front-end requirements. An appleaing and easy-to-use UI has helped improve the overall UX.`,

		{
			title: 'Emotion Detection and Classification in Speech',
			event: `Used the RAVDESS dataset and a CNN to build a system that detects the emotion in audio. Classifies the speech into 3 emotions - calm, happy, sad & happy. 
			Used the librosa lib in Python, and extracted the MFCC(Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) from the samples. I used the softmax and rmsprop activation functions and a batch size of 32.`,
